## Slowly moving up in the world
After developing many iOS apps, I realized I was capable of building something that could handle thousands of users. I wanted to create an app with an incredible purpose, something that could 
be used by tons of people and really help them as well. In this motivation the magic happened. 

Through tons of lobbying, meetings with representatives and employees, and negotiations, I present to you:

## The Land of A Thousand Hills Coffee App
[Land of a Thousand Hills Coffee](https://landofathousandhills.com) is a nationwide coffee chain bringing back the authentic, deep roast
coffee and donating many of its profits towards homelessness in Rwanda. I realized that this coffee chain did not have an online ordering app,
something it desperately needs in the year 2021. So this is where I decided to step in.

As shown on the picture on the right, the home screen of this application will push news feed updates based upon what initiatives Land of a Thousand Hills (LTH) is pushing that day. Using an API I am creating, LTH managers will be able to enter news feed updates, and when the app is loaded it will pull this refreshed data.

Of course with any online ordering application, we have to support a menu! Checkout this super pretty menu I've curated to fit the brand image of LTH. Here you can select a location, and depending on the location, load a menu that will allow you to mobile order a coffee for pickup. The POS system LTH uses is Toast, so utilizing a Toast integration we will be able to send order data to a Toast Terminal at a specific LTH location, so that baristas can prepare your coffee for you!

Finally, the last major technical challenge we have to support is in-app payment processing. Ever use an app like Starbucks or Chic-Fil-A? Notice how you have the ability to add funds to the application and pay directly from them. In order to support this same type functionality, I am utlizing Stripe's APIs, which allow for super easy payment processing support.

## Finale

The opportunity to work on an application that is going to support thousands of users and millions of dollars in transactions is something I am unbelievably excited about. The app is currently still in development and I have created a new private repo to hold the code.
